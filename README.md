X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) is rapidly becoming a popular technique for measuring the 3D geometry of plant organs, such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Due to the large size of these datasets (> 20 Gb per 3D image), along with the often irregular and complex geometries of many plant organs, image segmentation represents a substantial bottleneck in the scientific pipeline. Here, we are developing a Python module that utilizes machine learning to dramatically improve the efficiency of microCT image segmentation with minimal user input.
