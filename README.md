# 3DLeafCT
### Developing a machine learning pipeline for fast segmentation of 3D leaf microCT images

X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) is rapidly becoming a popular technique for measuring the 3D geometry of plant organs, such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Due to the large size of these datasets (> 20 Gb per 3D image), along with the often irregular and complex geometries of many plant organs, image segmentation represents a substantial bottleneck in the scientific pipeline. Here, we are developing a Python module that utilizes machine learning to dramatically improve the efficiency of microCT image segmentation with minimal user input.

Segmented images can be used for calculating novel leaf geometric traits that drive photosynthesis and transpiration, such as vapor diffusion path length
